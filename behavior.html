                    <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common type of talk therapy (psychotherapy). You work with a
                        mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist) in a structured way, attending a limited
                        number of sessions. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you become aware of incorrect or negative
                        thinking so that you can look at difficult situations from a clearer perspective and respond to
                        them in a more effective way. Parents are capable of behavioral therapy for their children. And

                    <p>Behavioral therapy for children with hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder is of two
                        types.
                        <br>

                        - Reducing bad behavioral habits and vandalism
                        - Try to make the child organized and train him on good habits.
                        <br>
                        How do we make the child train good behavioral habits?
                        <br>
                        - Focus on the child’s actions
                        Monitor him, set a daily schedule for the child, and help him accomplish his daily tasks
                        <br>
                        - Child reward
                        If the child completes his daily tasks, he is given a reward to motivate him to do more. If the
                        tasks are not accomplished, the child is deprived of the reward.
                        <br>
                        -Listen to the child
                        It is good to listen and understand your child’s feelings, as this makes you close to your child
                        and you become in the position of an understanding friend. Try to understand his mixed feelings
                        and reach a solution to his problems, thus you alleviate his burdens and internal conflicts.
                        <br>
                        - Participate in parent training programs with parent training specialists
                        <br>

                        - Social skills training
                        It is known that a child may feel introverted, so parents must take their child out of
                        isolation, and involve him in clubs to teach skills, integrate with other children, and
                        strengthen his skills.
                        <br>


                        How do we reduce negative and disruptive behavior?
                        <br>

                        -Lack of patience
                        Lack of patience in hyperactive and distracted children is a very common characteristic, and it
                        may hinder the performance of tasks in them, so they must be trained to be flexible, calm
                        themselves down, and apply penalties and penalties.

                        Your child may act aggressive and angry at times. He may hit another child. In this case, hold
                        your child’s arms and make eye contact with him, then tell him how wrong this behavior was and
                        what is the way to correct this behavior.

                        We know that this behavior bothers many parents, but there are several ways to exploit the
                        child’s movement. For example, give him some orders to keep him busy or play and drain his
                        energy. For example, the jumping

                        It is difficult for an ADHD child to concentrate for a long time. It is important to know how
                        long it takes your child to concentrate to make it easier for the child to deal with, and to set
                        a period of time to focus and then give him a short time for fun. There are manual games such as
                        balls or jelly balls that help the child to concentrate and extract his motor energy.

                        - Complex feelings
                        The child may become confused because of his mixed feelings, resulting in the child becoming
                        angry or crying. The correct solution is to train the child to know the current feelings and how
                        to cope with them
